# SKALE URL Shortener

## Try it

[skale.now.sh/s?id=2](https://medium.com/ethdenver/ethdenver-2020-official-bounties-b8b41135d881) should redirect to [medium.com/ethdenver/ethdenver-2020-official-bounties-b8b41135d881](https://medium.com/ethdenver/ethdenver-2020-official-bounties-b8b41135d881)

The shortened URLs expand normally in all browsers and mobile devices (even those that do not support web3)

## Setup

1) Connect metamask to your SKALE node

2) Get some test ETH from [SKALE faucet](http://faucet.skale.network/)

3) Shart shortening urls
(the shortened urls will expand even for users who do not have custom RPC metamask)
